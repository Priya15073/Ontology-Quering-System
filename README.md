# RDF-Triple-Store-and-SHACL-queries
Built an OWL ontology from the  Meetups data available on Kaggle
and converted the dataset into RDF triples according to the ontology.
Also, stored the triples into the built triple store using Apache Jena.
queried the said triple store using SPARQL and validated the RDF graph using SHACL.

This is our course project for the course Semantic Web in Winter 2019.
