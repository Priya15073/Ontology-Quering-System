"236780948","2017-01-09 00:37:41","From Wikipedia: Watt was Samuel Beckett's second published novel in English, largely written on the run in the south of France during the Second World War and published by Maurice Girodias's Olympia Press in 1953 (an extract had been published in the Dublin literary review, Envoy, in 1950). A French translation followed in 1968. Narrated in four parts, it describes Watt's journey to, and within, Mr Knott's house; where he becomes the reclusive owner's manservant, replacing Arsene, who delivers a long valedictory monologue at the end of section one. In section two Watt struggles to make sense of life at Mr Knott's house, experiencing deep anxiety at the visit of the piano-tuning Galls, father and son, and a mysteriously language-resistant pot, among other incidents. In section three, which has a narrator called Sam, Watt is in confinement, his language garbled almost beyond recognition, while the narrative veers off on fantastical tangents such as the story of Ernest Louit's account to a committee of Beckett's old university, Trinity College, Dublin of a research trip in the West of Ireland. The shorter fourth section shows Watt arriving at the railway station from which, in the novel's skewed chronology, he sets out on a journey to the institution he has already reached in section three. The novel concludes with a series of Addenda, whose incorporation into the text only fatigue and disgust have prevented, but which should nevertheless be carefully studied. These take the form of concepts and fragments apparently intended for the novel but not used.","7200","https://www.meetup.com/1001books/events/236780948/","others","0.00","not_found","per person","Price","0","2007-06-11 01:59:29","41.91999800","-87.65000200","523869","open","Read the Classics - The 1001 Books Challenge","1001books","Book Readers","0","not_found","0","Watt by Samuel Beckett","not_found","0.00","-1","-1","upcoming","2017-11-12 21:00:00","2017-03-29 03:29:16","-21600","2442 N Clark Street","not_found","Chicago","us","1111215","41.92667900","USA","-87.64135900","Galway Arms","-1","0","IL","-1","public","0","not_found","11"

"236956770","2017-01-16 04:24:26","From Goodreads:  A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale,A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.) But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave throughA Confederacy of Duncesare as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life.","10800","https://www.meetup.com/1001books/events/236956770/","others","0.00","not_found","per person","Price","0","2007-06-11 01:59:29","41.91999800","-87.65000200","523869","open","Read the Classics - The 1001 Books Challenge","1001books","Book Readers","0","not_found","0","A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole","not_found","0.00","-1","-1","upcoming","2017-10-29 20:00:00","2017-03-29 03:21:03","-18000","2442 N Clark Street","not_found","Chicago","us","1111215","41.92667900","USA","-87.64135900","Galway Arms","-1","0","IL","-1","public","0","not_found","20"
"236956804","2017-01-16 04:28:46","From Goodreads: Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted. In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day.The Underground Railroadis at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.","10800","https://www.meetup.com/1001books/events/236956804/","others","0.00","not_found","per person","Price","0","2007-06-11 01:59:29","41.91999800","-87.65000200","523869","open","Read the Classics - The 1001 Books Challenge","1001books","Book Readers","0","not_found","0","The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead","not_found","0.00","-1","-1","upcoming","2017-12-03 21:00:00","2017-01-16 04:28:46","-21600","2442 N Clark Street","not_found","Chicago","us","1111215","41.92667900","USA","-87.64135900","Galway Arms","-1","0","IL","-1","public","0","not_found","16"

"239961844","2017-05-13 18:20:06","From Wikipedia: The Foundation Pit isa gloomy symbolic and semi-satirical novel byAndrei Platonov. The plot of the novel concerns a group of workers living in the earlySoviet Union. They attempt to dig out a huge foundation pit on the base of which a gigantic house will be built for the country'sproletarians. The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy. In terms of creative works, Platonov depicted one of the first state-controlleddystopiasof the 20th century. The novel is often compared toGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-FourandAldous Huxley'sBrave New World.However, both English novels were published long before a translation ofThe Foundation Pitbecame available.[citation needed] Platonov's work is a representation of the conflict that arose between Russian individuals and the increasingly collectivized Soviet state in the late 1920s.The Foundation PitcritiquesJoseph Stalin's domestic policies and questions the validity of any regime advocating the belief that the only existence a person can have is being one part of a whole.

A sweeping saga, it tells the story of three school friends who meet in Moscow in the 1950s and go on to embody the heroism, folly, compromise, and hope of the Soviet dissident experience. These three boysan orphaned poet; a gifted, fragile pianist; and a budding photographer with a talent for collecting secretsstruggle to reach adulthood in a society where their heroes have been censored and exiled. Rich with love stories, intrigue, and a cast of dissenters and spies,The Big Green Tentoffers a panoramic survey of life after Stalin and a dramatic investigation into the prospects for integrity in a society defined by the KGB. Each of the central characters seeks to transcend an oppressive regime through art, a love of Russian literature, and activism. And each of them ends up face-to-face with a secret police that is highly skilled at fomenting paranoia, division, and self-betrayal.

"240507712","2017-06-03 16:14:50","The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a 2000 novel by Jewish American author Michael Chabon that won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001. The novel follows the lives of two Jewish cousins, Czech artist Joe Kavalier and Brooklyn-born writer Sammy Clay, before, during, and after World War II. In the novel, Kavalier and Clay become major figures in the comics industry from its nascency into its Golden Age. Kavalier & Clay was published to nearly unanimous praise and became a New York Times Best Seller,[1] receiving nominations for the 2000 National Book Critics Circle Award and PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. In 2006, Bret Easton Ellis declared the novel one of the three great books of my generation,[2] and in 2007, The New York Review of Books called the novel Chabon's magnum opus.[3] The novel's publication was followed by several companion projects, including two short stories published by Chabon that consist of material apparently written for the novel but not included: The Return of the Amazing Cavalieri in McSweeney's Quarterly Concern (2001), and Breakfast in the Wreck in The Virginia Quarterly Review (2004). In 2004, a coda to the novel was published separately under the title A Postscript, in Zap! Pow! Bam! The Superhero: The Golden Age of Comic Books, 19381950. From 2004 to 2006, Dark Horse Comics published two series of Escapist comic books based on the superhero stories described in the novel, some of which were written by Chabon. Dark Horse Comics also published a sequel to the novel, The Escapists, written by Brian K. Vaughan. A film adaptation, to be directed by Stephen Daldry and produced by Scott Rudin, began pre-production in 2001. In the following years, the project was repeatedly canceled and reinitiated; as of April 2017, the film is yet to be released.","10800","https://www.meetup.com/BucketListBooksNYC/events/240507712/","others","0.00","not_found","per person","Price","0","2010-01-03 18:43:38","40.72000100","-73.98000300","1576459","open","Bucket List Book Club:  Read what youve put off!","BucketListBooksNYC","Readers","0","not_found","0","The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay (Michael Chabon)","not_found","0.00","-1","-1","upcoming","2018-01-29 00:00:00","2017-10-14 14:51:01","-18000","140 2nd Ave","bet 8th / 9th Sts","New York","us","725010","40.72884000","USA","-73.98703000","Ukrainian East Village Restaurant","2125295024","0","NY","-1","public","0","not_found","50"

The book chronicles both the life of Oscar De Len, an overweight Dominican boy growing up in Paterson, New Jersey, who is obsessed with science fiction and fantasy novels and with falling in love, as well as the curse that has plagued his family for generations. Narrated by multiple characters, the novel incorporates a significant amount of Spanglish and neologisms, as well as references to fantasy and science fiction films and books. Through its overarching theme of the fuk curse, it additionally contains elements of magic realism. It received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised Daz's writing style and the multi-generational story.
